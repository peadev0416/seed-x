# Seed-X: Seed Classification System Simulation

This project simulates the local seed classification system used by Seed-X sorters, including API endpoints, real-time batching logic, and classification statistics.

## ðŸš€ Features

- Start/stop sorting sessions
- Simulate seed image ingestion
- Batch classification with `max_batch_size` and `max_single_image_latency_ms`
- Random classification: "accept" or "reject"
- Image sampling for inspection
- Query statistics & sampled image info
- (Optional) Upload and store real image files
